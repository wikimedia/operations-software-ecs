  short: Fields generated and normalized by the logging pipeline.
  description: >
    Fields generated and normalized by the logging pipeline, but normally hidden from view in
    the Kibana Discover app and saved search results in the Dashboard app.

    This field is intended to contain fields that generally duplicate other fields and clutter the view.

    This field is hidden superficially by an entry in the index pattern source filters.
  type: group
  fields:
    - name: message
      level: custom
      type: keyword
      example: "Hello World"
      short: Log message optimized for aggregations.
      description: >
        The message field downcased, truncated to 256 characters, and indexed in an aggregatable form.

        The downcasing and truncation is handled by the Logstash pipeline.

        Ideally, this should be a multi-field of the message field, but lacking a truncation feature, this
        behavior is currently impossible.  For more information, see: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60329

        Array of dropped field names due to no available field definition.

        Values in this field would normally be dropped silently by ElasticSearch.

      level: custom
      type: keyword
      short: Array of field names dropped due to a type conflict.
      description: >
        Array of dropped field names due to a type conflict.

        Values in this field are the equivalent of those in error type `mapper_parsing_exception`.
